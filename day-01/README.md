Day 1/100

Focus

For Day 1, I decided to build a mini project: an Advanced Todo App with features like filters and localStorage.

Why this project

I have already built a basic Todo app before, where I learned the fundamentals.
The purpose of building this version is to go beyond the basics and practice more advanced features, better structure, and cleaner logic.

What I aim to learn

Implementing filters (All / Active / Completed)
Persisting data using localStorage
Improving state management and component structure
Writing cleaner and more maintainable code

Goal

The goal is not just to finish the project, but to understand the logic behind each feature and improve my overall approach to building React applications.

Mindset

Consistency matters more than speed.
This is Day 1 — let’s build, learn, and keep moving forward.
