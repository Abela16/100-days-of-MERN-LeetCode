Focus

Learning DSA basics and reviewing code from 
previously built projects.

What I worked on
 -Learned core DSA topics for problem-solving
 -Solved LeetCode problems easy to practice new concepts
    -Majority Element(https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1861844848/)
    -Move Zeroes(https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1860973003/)
 -Reviewed React patterns:
    -Rendering lists of data with correct key usage
    -Conditional rendering based on state

Key takeaways
 -Proper use of keys is critical for predictable list    rendering in React
 -Conditional rendering improves readability and maintainability
 -Revisiting old code helps identify gaps and improve implementation
 -Practicing problems reinforces DSA fundamentals in a practical way
