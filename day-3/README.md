day-3/ 100 

Today, I completed the Advanced To-Do App that I started on Day 1.
The goal of this project was not just to build a to-do list, but to 
understand data flow, state management, and persistence in React.

What this app can do
- Add new todos
- Display a list of todos
- Filter todos by status (All / Active / Completed)
- Delete todos
- Persist data using localStorage

What I learned from this project
- How data flows between React components
- How to implement filtering logic
- How to save and retrieve data from localStorage
- How to structure components more cleanly
